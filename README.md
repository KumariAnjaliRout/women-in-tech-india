# women-in-tech-india

This project visualizes the percentage and distribution of female participation in tech education across different states and union territories of India using interactive data visualizations.

## Features

- Choropleth map showing female participation percentage across Indian states.
- Bar chart of states with the **highest number** and **lowest number** of female students.
- Bar chart of top 10 states with the **highest percentage** of female participation.
- Bar chart of bottom 10 states with the **lowest percentage** of female participation.

## Files

- `app.py` – Main Streamlit app file.
- `women_in_tech_full.csv` – Dataset used.
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python package dependencies.

In the upcoming extension of this project, I aim to visualize the growth of women's participation in CS/IT jobs across Indian states by integrating datasets such as AICTE graduate statistics, LinkedIn public profiles, and job market trends from platforms like Naukri.com. This analysis will highlight shifts in job domains (e.g., development, data science, cybersecurity), explore wage gap patterns, and identify the most inclusive companies and regions in terms of gender diversity. By comparing female education output with actual hiring trends, the project will provide a comprehensive overview of how education translates into industry presence, offering valuable insights for policy, hiring, and inclusion strategies.
